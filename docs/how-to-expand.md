# How to Expand the Project

This guide covers upgrading the client-side of the SP2025 CMS system from plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript to modern frameworks.

## üöÄ Client-Side Framework Upgrades

The current client implementation uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For more complex user interfaces and better development experience, you can upgrade to modern JavaScript frameworks.

### **React Integration**

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides:

- Component-based architecture for reusable UI elements
- Virtual DOM for efficient rendering
- Rich ecosystem of libraries and tools
- Strong community support and documentation

To upgrade to React, you would need to:

- Install React and related dependencies
- Convert HTML templates to React components
- Set up a build system (like Vite or Create React App)
- Migrate existing JavaScript functionality to React hooks and state management

### **Angular Integration**

Angular is a comprehensive framework for building web applications. It offers:

- Full-featured framework with built-in tools
- TypeScript support for better type safety
- Dependency injection system
- Built-in routing and form handling
- Comprehensive testing utilities

To upgrade to Angular, you would need to:

- Install Angular CLI and create a new Angular project
- Convert HTML templates to Angular components
- Migrate JavaScript logic to TypeScript services
- Set up Angular routing for navigation
- Configure Angular forms for data handling

### **Next.js Integration**

Next.js is a full-stack React framework that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes. In this architecture, Next.js would replace both the frontend client and the NestJS server, communicating directly with the Strapi CMS.

Next.js offers:

- Server-side rendering (SSR) for better SEO and performance
- Static site generation (SSG) for fast loading
- API routes for backend functionality
- Built-in routing and optimization
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Image optimization and performance features

To implement Next.js in this project:

- Replace the current client and server with a single Next.js application
- Use Next.js API routes instead of NestJS controllers
- Implement server-side rendering for articles and pages
- Communicate directly with Strapi API endpoints
- Leverage Next.js caching and optimization features

This approach simplifies the architecture by having one application handle both frontend and backend responsibilities while maintaining the Strapi CMS for content management.

### **Framework Selection Considerations**

When choosing between React, Angular, and Next.js:

- **React**: Lighter weight, more flexible, better for smaller to medium applications
- **Angular**: More opinionated, comprehensive, better for large enterprise applications
- **Next.js**: Full-stack solution, replaces both frontend and backend, ideal for content-heavy applications

All frameworks will provide better development experience, improved maintainability, and enhanced user interface capabilities compared to plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
